*Consider a course where NetLogo is used as the primary programming language (or one of them). 

#NetLogo Day 1- SWBAT control and explain a NetLogo model of their choosing.

##What is modeling?- Direct instruction 
- models are constructs to help us attempt to better understand real-world systems and situations
- "All models are wrong but some are useful." George E.P. Box

##Real world examples of how modeling can be used- what industries, technologies, etc use models to benefit/ improve the world or to engage in commerce?- Discussion, try to guide towards samples below
Ex - Objective 
Weather - prediction
Flight Simulation - Training
Nuclear Arms Race - Strategy Development
Traffic Flow - Regulation 
Predator-Prey - Management
All the above have function of--> Explanation and understanding systems/ the world

##Sample Model Walk Through: Wolf Sheep Predation
###Explain why the Wolf/Sheep predation would be used, how beneficial
###Controlling the Model: Buttons
###Controlling speed: Speed Slider
###Adjusting Settings: Choosers, Sliders, and Switches
###Gathering Information: Plots and Monitors
###Controlling the View
###Models Library Overview

##Individual practice
- Pick a Model from the model library and attempt to explain the following:
1) What is the name of the model?
2) What happens when you change the buttons?
3) What happens when you change the speed/ switches/ sliders?
4) What information do you get from the plots and monitors?
5) What real world purpose would this model serve? Who would benefit from this model?
6) Extra credit- what is a situation or model that you would be interested in seeing?

##Why would you choose to do things that way?
I would choose this format because it is a balance of direct instruction and exploration.  It is probably way way too much for 1 lesson - perhaps on a second intro lesson I would intro 1 key part of netlogo per day and combining with ample exploration time.
