# Unplugged Activity:
Linked Lists!  
- Llist coolLists = new Llist();
---
## Overall Goal:
To deepen understanding of linkedlists by acting out the operations typically performed on Linked Lists. (The actual content of the lists could be class/grade dependent, but the basic framework would stay the same)
---
## Concepts:
**Alphabet**
- Have students pretend to be nodes, and order themselves by first name, then last name. Introduce new students to the class. Model inserting/removing with actual people in line.
**Music**
- Top 10s: have students in groups pick their top 10 music artists, then rearrange them. (Or could be sports or whatever.)
**Household Lists**
- Students create and modify a grocery list
- Students create and modify a Christmas list
- Amazon wishlist
---
## Topics:
**Insertion**
- A new student joins the class; how do they get inserted into the alphabetical list?
- One group wants to add an artist to the top 10 list
- Add something to the grocery list (have student act this out)
**Deletion**
- Remove a student from the list using the proper methods
- One group wants to remove an artist from the top 10 list
- Delete something from the grocery list
---
## Small Group Practice:
- Maybe divide into two groups - those getting/receiving directions
- Those receiving are the nodes (they can only know what they are and who they point to.)
- Those giving directions have to use the rules of linkedlists (for insertion and deletion) to add/remove nodes to the lists
- There needs to be some kind of assessment mechanism--either housed in the nodes themselves or a third role - to make sure that everyone follows the rules for inserting/deleting from the lists.
- Is there a way to make this competitive?
---
- Alt version: make it creative performance
- After direction instruction (learning the rules), then folks have to demonstrate understanding by creating a performance for a group of peers
- Options include dance choreography, acting, singing, musical
- Example might be: a song like "I'm just a bill" from Schoolhouse Rock, only "I'm just a node" that goes on to encapsulate how nodes get linked into linked lists
- End product *is* the performance
- (There would be clear assessment criteria for the performance, including which concepts need to be represented in the performance)
---
- (Music example)
- Draw out your list
- Rank your favorite artists in order of preference
- Re-arrange your list in order of alphabetical order
- Leave your list, next group comes and deletes one artist and inserts an artist of their choosing
- Groups present original list and then changes to list (including insertion/ deletion) to the whole group
- What is your current node?
**Roles:**
- Giving instructions
- Receiving instructions (i.e., the nodes)
- Someone to evaluate whether the instructions are properly given? (Or can this be done by the nodes?)
**Extensions:(xxxtentacions)**
- Add a non-example / show how NOT to add to / delete from a list
---
## Q/C/C:
- Are online shopping carts made using linked lists?
- When something is deleted is it removed from the computer's memory?
- Does pseudocode count as an unplugged activity?
