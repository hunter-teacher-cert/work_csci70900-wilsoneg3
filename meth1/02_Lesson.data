 Assignment:
    - Create a live-code experience by writing code (or using existing code) and annotating it with teacher-facing comments that would explain how to develop that code live.
    - Include questions for students, when to pause, when to ask for predictions, purposeful mistakes, etc.
 - Use whatever file format that is more convenient for you, but name the file **02_livecode** and put it in your **meth1** folder.

 function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400); // create a canvas
	
}
function draw() {
  background(220); // set the background color to 220
	strokeWeight(7);
	
// 	Draw a point near the top-right corner of the canvas.
	point(200, 200); // this is not in the middle on purpose 
	

// Draw a point in the middle of the canvas. 
	point 
// Draw a point near the bottom-left.
// Draw a horizontal line, a vertical line, and a diagonal line anywhere.
// Draw a line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
	text("X: "+mouseX+" Y: "+mouseY, 20, 20); //this code tells you the x & y position of your mouse. You can use this information to place your points and lines correctly
