The intended student audience for these lessons are 16-21 year olds in a transfer high school.  Limited experience with language-based programming, perhaps some experience with Scratch in middle school, huge variation in Algebra mastery but likely not beyond algebra 3.  

Lesson 1 is intended as a revamp of a lesson I taught in Intro to Computational Media where we combine different system variables and teach them in one lesson.  This lesson has had a few iterations but this one involves the return to deliberate use of paired programming. I still want to add an offline metaphor for system variables but am working on that.

Lesson 2 is intended as a revamp of a Scratch lesson I taught as part of Exploring Computer Science.  This lesson is largely designed for individual practice and uses the pedagogical technique of providing pseudo code with notes for the students to complete.
