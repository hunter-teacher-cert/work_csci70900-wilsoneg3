1) Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

-- When ping is invoked, the system returns a period

-- When baffle is invoked, the system returns "wug" and then invokes ping.

2) What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.*

No,I
Wug
.
You wugga
Wug
.
I
Wug

3) Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.*

Main
- zoop
- baffle
- ping 

3) What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

This would create an infinte loop because the baffle would keep returning to the ping and the ping would keep running the baffle.  Rinse and repeat. Forever and ever. Amen.  

public static void zoop() {
    baffle();2
    System.out.print("You wugga ");4
    baffle();5
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("No, I ");1
    zoop();2
    System.out.print("I ");6
    baffle();7
}

public static void baffle() {
    System.out.print("wug");257
    ping();
}

public static void ping() {
    System.out.println(".");358
}
